  “My uncle has most honest principles:
  when he was taken gravely ill,
  he forced one to respect him
  and nothing better could invent.
  To others his example is a lesson;
  but, good God, what a bore to sit
  by a sick person day and night, not stirring
  a step away!
  What base perfidiousness
  to entertain one half-alive,
  adjust for him his pillows,
  sadly serve him his medicine,
  sigh — and think inwardly
  when will the devil take you?”
